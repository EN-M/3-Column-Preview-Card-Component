I butchered this one.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

it has a lot of problems.
someday I will come back stronger and optimize my code.
I did this in two sessions and started from the web and then to mobile.
I have a long way to learn flexbox properly yet mastering it.

there are two major problems(three, if you count not knowing how to use flexbox ):
the first one is the "SUV" title. it has some space between itself and the left side and I tried to hide it using some padding-right.

the second and most important one is that after changing flex-direction in @media, I faced some issues. tried my best to fix them but one persisted.
after changing flex-direction to column, half of my top div disappeared.
I couldn't find any real solution, so I tried to hide it using some margin-top.

so any help to fix these problems and improving the overall code is highly appreciated.
